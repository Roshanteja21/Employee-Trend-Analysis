# Employee-Trend-Analysis

# 📊 HR Data Analysis using SQL  

## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing HR employee data to uncover key insights and trends. The dataset includes employee details across various departments, covering demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, attrition rates, and more.  

By leveraging **SQL**, I explored the data, answered critical business questions, and derived **actionable insights** to support decision-making.  

## 🚀 Skills & Tools  
- **SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server)**  
- **Data Exploration & Cleaning**  
- **Aggregations & Trend Analysis**  
- **Joins, Grouping & Conditional Logic**  
- **Attrition & Satisfaction Insights**  

## 🛠️ Key Tasks Performed  
✅ Performed data exploration and validation checks for accuracy  
✅ Analyzed employee counts, distributions, and averages across departments  
✅ Identified top job roles and satisfaction levels per department  
✅ Calculated **attrition rates by age band** to pinpoint high-risk groups  
✅ Investigated factors influencing attrition, such as **age, education, and job satisfaction**  
✅ Compared key metrics across different employee segments  
✅ Highlighted top and bottom performers based on key HR metrics  
✅ Utilized advanced SQL techniques (**JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, CASE statements**)  

## 📈 Insights & Findings  
🔹 Departments with **higher job satisfaction** tend to have **lower attrition rates**  
🔹 Younger employees (**below 30**) showed higher attrition trends, indicating retention challenges  
🔹 Specific job roles had consistently low satisfaction, highlighting potential **engagement issues**  
🔹 Education levels showed minimal correlation with attrition, suggesting **other dominant factors**
